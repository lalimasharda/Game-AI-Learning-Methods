All the code has been written in Java Processing.

1. For the 1st part, the folder New3 contains the character decision making. Run "New3.pde" to execute the first part of the assignment.
2. The solution for the second part is in folder Part2. Run "BehaviourTree.pde" to run the solution.
3. The solution for the third part is in folder Part3. Run "BehaviourTree.pde" to run the solution.

Please Note: It may be possible that both or one of the characters do not appear on the screen. 
Press run/play button again for them to appear on the screen. Its just that the characters probably gets drawn too soon.
